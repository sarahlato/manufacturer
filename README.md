Simple batch script that somewhat automates the installation of MediaTek Android ROMs

# THIS WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE USED BY OTHER PEOPLE!
While you can use this, much better tools exist like Palutenfan123's. It was made to be tied together with string and work to help people through the process of installing my ROM, but the code is not fancy at all. This is mostly here for auditing reasons.

You absolutely CAN reuse the code - the reason it's not GPL licensed is because the associated ROM and files are either compiled or licensed by others confusingly. I'm not dealing with that legal headache. As for the scripts themselves, you can use them however you want. I don't even care about attribution.
